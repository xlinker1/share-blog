[The Beatles - Real Love 【4K修复】\_哔哩哔哩\_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Nh411H7XS)

随机到这首歌，好听。颇有点泫然欲泣。
风格和imagine和jealous guy很像。

歌词里不断重复着“real love”，可果真如此吗？
听歌会发现里面有很多不安的和弦。不安，悲哀，有点绝望，带着一点天塌地陷的感觉。
但是只要你爱我，就是美好甜蜜，如梦似幻，有点不真实的“It's real love”了。

这歌太悲了，还是少听点好。听点傻乐的歌开心一下

All my little plans and schemes  
Lost like some forgotten dreams  
Seems that all I really was doing  
Was waiting for you  
  
Just like little girls and boys  
Playing with their little toys  
Seems like all they really were doing  
Was waiting for love  
  
Don't need to be alone  
No need to be alone  
It's real love, it's real  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
  
From this moment on I know  
Exactly where my life will go  
Seems that all I really was doing  
Was waiting for love  
  
Don't need to be afraid  
No need to be afraid  
It's real love, it's real  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
  
Thought I'd been in love before  
But in my heart, I wanted more  
Seems like all I really was doing  
Was waiting for you  
  
Don't need to be alone  
Don't need to be alone  
It's real love, yes it's real  
It's real love, it's real  
  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
It's real love, it's real  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
It's real love, it's real  
  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
It's real love, it's real  
Yes it's real love, it's real

All my little plans and schemes  
Lost like some forgotten dreams  
Seems that all I really was doing  
Was waiting for you  
我所有的那些小把戏
如同被遗忘的梦境消散无踪
也许我一直以来所做的事情
都是为了等待你
  
Just like little girls and boys  
Playing with their little toys  
Seems like all they really were doing  
Was waiting for love  
就像小男孩小女孩
玩着他们的玩具
也许他们也一直都在
等待爱的到来
  
Don't need to be alone  
No need to be alone  
It's real love, it's real  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
不再是一个人了
不再感到孤独了
这就是真实的爱，这是真的
是的，这是真爱，这是真的
  
From this moment on I know

我的人生将走向何方
也许我一直以来所做的事情
都是在等待你的爱
  
Don't need to be afraid  
No need to be afraid  
It's real love, it's real  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
不再害怕了
不再胆怯了
这就是真实的爱，这是真的
是的，这是真爱，这是真的
  
Thought I'd been in love before  
But in my heart, I wanted more  
Seems like all I really was doing  
Was waiting for you  
我以为我以前曾恋爱过
但在我心里，我想要更多
也许我的过去
一直都在期待着你

Don't need to be alone  
Don't need to be alone  
It's real love, yes it's real  
It's real love, it's real  
不再是一个人了
不再感到孤独了
这就是真实的爱，这是真的
是的，这是真爱，这是真的
  
Yes it's real love, it's real  
It's real love, it's real
